<b>About:</b>
This bot is a chat with a scientist from the past - <b>Yuri Belov.</b>   


There are different sections of this bot:

<b>Chat</b>
You can talk with Yuri about anything you want - he is very curious to speak with someone from the future. 
You can ask him about his life, or about mathematics and computer science. He is quite a catch!
But keep in mind - this time machine does not allow cyrillic symbols, so you can communicate only in English.

<b>Mathematics</b>
Here you can learn about the history of mathematics in Russia, or get some theoretical knowledge. Yuri will gladly share some books form his personal library.
Additionaly, you can challenge yourself by some tasks with various levels of difficulty and compete with others. Your progress will be displayed in the leaderboard.

<b>Programming</b>
Along with the history of programming, you can learn the basics of some Soviet languages: REFAL-5, EL-76 and RAPIRA.
There is a contest with the programming tasks, featuring a leaderboard as well.
Additionaly, you can try our experimental feature: code translator. You just send code in Python or C++ and bot gives you its equivalent in Soviet programming language.
